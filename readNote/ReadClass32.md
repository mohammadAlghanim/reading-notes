# What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?
Django Rest Framework (DRF) provides a set of powerful tools for building web APIs in Django. Permissions in DRF are a key component that help in securing an API by controlling access to resources based on user authentication and authorization. Permissions determine whether a user is allowed to perform a certain action on a particular resource.

DRF offers several built-in permission classes, each serving a specific purpose. Here are the key components and purposes of DRF permissions:

IsAuthenticated: This permission class ensures that the user making the request is authenticated. It denies access to unauthenticated users and allows only authenticated users to access the protected resources.

IsAdminUser: This permission class restricts access to administrative users only. It requires the user to have the is_staff flag set to True in their user profile.

AllowAny: This permission class allows unrestricted access to all users, whether they are authenticated or unauthenticated. It is typically used for publicly available resources that don't require any authentication.

# In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?
In SQL, the SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database. It is one of the most fundamental and commonly used statements in SQL. The purpose of the SELECT statement is to query a database table or view and fetch data based on specified criteria.

To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees' using the SELECT statement, you can use the asterisk (*) symbol as a wildcard to represent all columns. Here's an example SQL query:

sql
```
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
In this query, the SELECT keyword is followed by the asterisk (*) symbol, which represents all columns. The FROM keyword is used to specify the table name 'employees' from which you want to retrieve data.

Executing this query will return all the columns and rows from the 'employees' table, providing a result set with all the available information stored in that table.

# Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?
Django Rest Framework (DRF) provides a set of powerful features to simplify the process of building RESTful APIs. One of the key features is the set of DRF Generic Views. These views are pre-built classes that encapsulate common API patterns, reducing the amount of code you need to write for common CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations. They are designed to promote code reusability and follow RESTful conventions.

Here are some of the commonly used DRF Generic Views and examples of their usage in building a RESTful API:

APIView: The APIView class is the base class for all DRF generic views. It provides the core functionality for handling HTTP requests and responses. You can override its methods to define custom behavior for various HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Here's an example:
```
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response

class EmployeeAPIView(APIView):
    def get(self, request):
        # Retrieve all employees
        employees = Employee.objects.all()
        # Serialize the data
        serializer = EmployeeSerializer(employees, many=True)
        # Return the serialized data in the response
        return Response(serializer.data)

```
