Take a break: Sometimes, stepping away from the problem for a few minutes or even a few hours can help you come back with a fresh perspective. Take a walk, grab a snack, or work on something else for a little while before returning to the problem.

-Break the problem down: If the problem feels overwhelming, try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Start by identifying the smallest piece of the problem you can solve, and work your way up from there.

-Get a second opinion: Sometimes, it can be helpful to talk through the problem with someone else. Find a colleague, mentor, or friend who is knowledgeable in the area and ask for their input. They may be able to provide a new insight or approach that you hadn’t considered.
