# What is the primary purpose of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how do they work in terms of encoding and decoding data?
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. They are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications. The primary purpose of JWTs is to securely transmit information between a client and a server as a JSON object.

JWTs consist of three parts: the header, the payload, and the signature. Here's a breakdown of how they work in terms of encoding and decoding data
# How does JWT Authentication integrate with Django REST Framework to secure API endpoints, and what are the key components involved in this process?
JWT authentication can be integrated with Django REST Framework (DRF) to secure API endpoints by using the "djangorestframework_simplejwt" library, which provides JWT authentication support. Here are the key components involved in this process
# Why is Djangoâ€™s built-in runserver not suitable for production environments, and what are some alternative server options that should be considered for deploying a Django application?
Django's built-in runserver command is not suitable for production environments for several reasons:

Security: The runserver command is not designed to handle security concerns adequately. It is a lightweight development server that is convenient for local development but lacks the robust security features required in production environments. It does not provide features like SSL/TLS encryption, load balancing, or fine-grained access controls.

Performance: The runserver command is single-threaded and not optimized for handling high traffic or concurrent requests. It is not intended to handle the performance demands of a production application.
