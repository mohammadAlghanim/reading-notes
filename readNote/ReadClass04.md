# Classes and Objects,Thinking Recursively
Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. Classes define the blueprint for creating objects, while objects are instances of classes that contain data and behavior specific to that instance.
## What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?
- In Python, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.
- Classes define the properties and behavior of objects, while objects contain specific values for those properties.
- To create an instance of a class, we use the class name followed by parentheses, and can then access its properties and methods using dot notation.
## Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?
Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself until a base case is reached. It is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.<br />
For example, the factorial function can be implemented using recursion in Python:
```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

```
Best practices for implementing a recursive function include defining a base case, ensuring that the function will converge on the base case, and minimizing unnecessary recursive calls.

## What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.

Pytest fixtures provide a way to share setup and teardown code across tests, while code coverage measures the percentage of code that is executed during testing.

By using fixtures to set up the test environment and code coverage to identify untested code, developers can improve the quality and maintainability of a project by ensuring that all code paths are tested and that tests are consistently and efficiently set up and executed.
