# FileIO & Exceptions
---
## What is the purpose of the ‘with’ statement when opening a file in Python, and how does it help manage resources while reading and writing files?
The with statement in Python is used to simplify the management of resources like files, sockets, etc. It automatically handles the acquisition and release of resources. When opening a file, it ensures the file is properly closed, even in the case of an exception.
## Explain the difference between the ‘read()’ and ‘readline()’ methods for file objects in Python. Provide examples of when to use each method.
The read() method reads the entire contents of a file as a string, while the readline() method reads a single line of the file. read() is useful when you want to process the entire file at once, while readline() is useful when you want to process the file line by line.
## Briefly describe the concept of exception handling in Python. How can the ‘try’, ‘except’, and ‘finally’ blocks be used to handle exceptions and ensure proper execution of code? Provide a simple example.
Exception handling is a way to catch and handle errors during program execution in Python. try contains the code that might throw an exception, except contains the code that handles the exception, and finally contains code that executes regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. Here is a simple example:
```
python
Copy code
try:
    # code that might throw an exception
except ExceptionType:
    # code to handle the exception
finally:
    # code that executes regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
```
