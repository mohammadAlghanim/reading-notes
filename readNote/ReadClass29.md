# What are the key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model, and how does it differ from the default Django User Model?
Using a Django Custom User Model offers several key benefits compared to the default Django User Model. Here are the main advantages:

Flexibility: With a Custom User Model, you have full control over the user model's fields and behavior. You can define additional fields that are specific to your application's requirements, such as profile information, additional contact details, or any other data you need to associate with a user. This flexibility allows you to tailor the user model to fit your application's unique needs.

Scalability: The Custom User Model allows you to easily extend the user model in the future without the need for database schema migrations. You can add or modify fields without affecting the underlying Django User Model, making it more scalable as your application evolves over time.


# Explain the process of creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django, including the necessary changes to settings.py and the required model fields.
To create and implement a Custom User Model in Django, you need to follow these steps:

Create a new Django app:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to your Django project's root directory.
Run the command: python manage.py startapp accounts (replace "accounts" with the desired app name).
Define the Custom User Model:

In the newly created app directory, open the models.py file.
Import the necessary modules:
```
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

```
