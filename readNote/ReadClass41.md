Explain the concept of dynamic routes in Next.js and how they differ from static routes.
basically, dynamic routes in Next.js enable the creation of pages with variable URLs and dynamic content, while static routes have fixed URLs and serve pre-rendered content that doesn't change based on user input.

The choice between dynamic and static routes depends on the requirements of the application and the content we want to present to the users.

Deploying a Next.js application means making the application available on the internet so that users can access it via a public URL. It's like publishing the website or web application so that people can visit and use it online.

The key steps involved in deploying a Next.js application:

Build the Next.js Application

Choose a Hosting Platform : Vercel,Netlify,Heroku

Prepare Configuration Files: Some hosting platforms require specific configuration files. For example, Vercel uses vercel.json, while Netlify uses netlify.toml

Deploy the Application:

The actual deployment process depends on the hosting platform we choose. For Vercel, we can use the vercel CLI to deploy our application. Run the following command in your project directory: vercel

Verify and Test the Deployment
Monitor and Maintain

Next.js serves static assets like images, CSS, and fonts directly to the client without server-side rendering. The default folder for static assets is "public," placed in the project root. Assets in this folder can be referenced using their relative paths in components. For images, Next.js provides the optimized "next/image" component. For other assets, standard HTML or CSS imports can be used. Next.js automatically serves these files from the "public" folder during deployment, improving performance and caching.
