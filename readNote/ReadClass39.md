# What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?
React Context is a feature in React that allows data to be shared and accessed by components without the need to pass props manually through all the intermediate components. It provides a way to manage state and data at a global level in a React application. Context is primarily used to avoid prop drilling, which can become cumbersome and harder to maintain as the application grows larger.
# Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component. 
The useContext hook is a built-in hook in React that allows functional components to consume data from a React Context without the need to use the Consumer component. It provides a simple and straightforward way to access the shared data within a functional component, making it a popular choice for managing state and data sharing in React applications.    
# Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.
Next.js is a popular React framework used for building server-side rendered (SSR) and static websites. It aims to simplify the development process by providing many built-in features and optimizations. Next.js offers several benefits, including server-side rendering, static site generation, automatic code splitting, and simplified routing, making it a powerful tool for building scalable web applications.
