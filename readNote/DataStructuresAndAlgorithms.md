# Data Structures and Algorithms

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
One important thing to consider when selecting a data structure in Python is the type of operations that will be performed on the data, such as insertion, deletion, or searching.

Different data structures have different strengths and weaknesses with respect to these operations.

Choosing the appropriate data structure can significantly impact the efficiency and performance of your Python program.
## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
### 1-Ensure that the base case is well-defined and will eventually be reached.
### 2-Check for terminating conditions or constraints that prevent further recursion.
### 3-Use an iterative approach or a helper function if recursion is not the best solution for the problem.
